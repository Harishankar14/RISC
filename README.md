HPC KERNAL PILOT 

-So i desgined an Dynamic framework, which basically allows you perform high performance computation through dynammic kernal selection and Execution.

Majorly most of the researchers face issue inorder to benchmark their operation.. or compare which one is vital or plays a good role..
The framework allows developers and researchers to benchmark and experiment with various computation kernels CPU, GPU-simulated, and SIMD using OpenMP..
For now i have limited upto Matrix Multiplication, In the future, i will be pushing for major operations like Image processing !
